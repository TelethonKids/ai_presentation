# Session Overview

# Session Overview

This is an informal session, we do not have all the answers, please asks questions/add your perspective whenever relevant.

*Topics:*

1. Risks and data governance

2. AI (LLMs) may be more powerful than you think...

3. Prompt engineering

4. Their are efficiencies to be gained, keep up or be left behind (?)

5. Trust, and the roll of expertise in the process

6. AI in other aspects of your research 

7. Discussion

# Some language

LLM is a term you will may be familiar with. Large Language Model, this refers to a model trained on a large value of text (generally from a variety of sources) for the **purpose of generating further text**, typically in response to prompts. 

Or, AI Chat Bot. 

--

There are many of these out there, OpenAI's ChatGPT may be the most well known. 

We'll use chat bot/AI/LLM interchangeably.

---

# But first, a show of hands

Who here has...

--

- Already tried using a AI to assist in their coding?

--

- Who has thought about it, but didn't know where to start?

--

- Who has a paid subscription to an AI bot?

--

- Who has generated a graph using AI?

--

- Who has uploaded data into an AI bot?

# Risks and data governance

---

# Risks and data governance

Telethon Kids has an 'AI Policy' in draft - not out for review yet.

**DO NOT** upload your data to an AI bot:
- this is an ethics, governance, data governance breach
- unless the AI resides solely on the server specific and approved within your study documentation


---

# Data anonymiser app

Available now on a TKI server, is an app that will: 

--

- accept your dataset (.csv/.xlsx), and
- return a dataset with anonymised column header

--

The returned dataset (.csv) has:

--

- obscured column headers,
- data that broadly reflects your original data
  - continuous (and date) data within a similar range
  - the same number of categories for categorical data (assuming <15)
  - obsecured data for other character variables

--

Your data are destroyed when the app is closed. 

--

Soon to be added - An R function that will also do this.

# AI in other aspects of research

There are AI based platforms and apps to assist in many other areas of research, beyond statistical coding and analysis. 

Not necessarily surprising given their strength is ingesting large volumes of text and forming connections within/between text based content.

Some examples:

--
- [SciSpace - Typeset](https://typeset.io/)
    - Paraphrasing and literature review.
- [scholarcy - Summerizer](https://www.scholarcy.com/article-summarizer)
    - File upload (and URL) based summerizer.
- [consensus - Balance of evidence](https://consensus.app/)
    - Tries to indicate whether most papers support or negate a premise.
- [Scite - Assistant](https://scite.ai/assistant)
    - Ask questions, get explanations with citations (and citation previews) - think Introduction.
- [Semantic Scholar - Skim reader](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/semantic-reader)
    - Highlights and tags content within a paper.

# Semantic Scholar - Skim reader

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/other_skim.png")
```

---

# AI in other aspects of research

- Most offer a free demo and/or free account

- Most have subscriptions that are relatively cheap ($10-$20 per month)

- New/alternate platforms likely to appear regularly

- Current platforms may come offline (copyright?) or be acquired and merged/closed
